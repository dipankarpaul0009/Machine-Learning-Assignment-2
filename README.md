# Machine-Learning-Assignment-2
# House Price Predicting Model (using Linear Regression)

This project is part of my Machine Learning assignment. It focuses on predicting housing prices using Linear Regression, trained on the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle.

# About the Assignment -2 

The model is built using scikit-learn tools.

It learns from historical housing price data to predict property values in specific regions.

After training, the model is evaluated on test data to measure prediction accuracy.

# Files

.ipynb â†’ Implemented and executed in Google Colab.

# Workflow

1. Load the Kaggle dataset with pandas.

2. Perform necessary data preprocessing.

3. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

4. Train the model on the training data.

5. Apply regularization and implement Linear Regression.

6. Evaluate the model on test data, comparing training vs. testing accuracy.

7. Visualize results with relevant plots and graphs.

8. Make predictions on selected test data points and display the outcomes graphically.
